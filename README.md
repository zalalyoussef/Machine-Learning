Each script demonstrates a specific method or algorithm, including implementation details and visualizations. The code is designed to be educational and modular, making it suitable for learning and experimentation.

**Key Highlights:**

**Clustering Algorithms:**

K-Means clustering with inertia analysis.
Hierarchical clustering with dendrogram visualization.

**Dimensionality Reduction:**

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature reduction and data visualization.
t-SNE for non-linear dimensionality reduction.

**Support Vector Machines:**

Classification with SVMs using linear and RBF kernels.
Hyperparameter tuning via grid search and visualization of decision boundaries.

**Data Visualization:**

Heatmaps, scatter plots, and other visual aids for exploring datasets and model performance.
Data Handling:

Examples with real-world datasets like breast cancer and synthetic datasets
